## Lab 2:  ICP & Occupancy Grid Mapping

In the present repository, the code developed for all the AUVE Lab 2 is presented. Moreover, in the report attached the analysis of the results obtained can be found. Each section contains a small explanation of the steps followed -including code snippets- and a brief discussing of the results. All the results shown in this document are of own elaboration and were obtained by running the lab scripts developed using Python 3.8.5, OpenCv 4.4.0, Numpy 1.19.4 and Matplotlib 3.3.2 on December 28th, 2020.
To use the program developed you must download the dataset and add it to the Dataset directory folder.
